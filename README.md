# aiimeta - AI Image Metadata Viewer for Windows

aiimeta is a small Windows app to show metadata of AI-generated images,
including prompt texts, used models, and other parameters such as noise seed or CFG scale.

If you are a user of [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
(often called "A1111"),
you may know its "PNG Info" function.
aiimeta works like it.

## Environment and Prerequisites

aiimeta is a .NET 10 WPF app running on Windows 11 computers.
Other operating systems are not supported.

You will need to install the .NET Desktop Runtime on your PC to run the aiimeta app.
See below for how to install it.

aiimeta doesn't use Python.
You don't need Python on you PC to run aiimeta.

## Usage

### Installing and Running

1. Download a binary ZIP file from the _Releases_ page.
2. Create a new empty folder at your convenient location in your PC.
3. Unzip the downloaded file and copy all the content files to the new folder.
4. Double click the `aiimeta.exe` on your File Explorer.

### Installing .NET Desktop Runtime

You need .NET Desktop Runtime installed on your PC to run aiimeta.

You can download it from the Microsoft website:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0.
Choose and download the installer for ".NET Desktop Runtime" available on the page,
then run the downloaded installer.

Alternatively, you can just install the aiimeta app and try to run it.
If you have already installed the required runtime, the app just starts.
If not, Windows suggests you to download and install the required .NET Desktop Runtime.
You can simply click OK several times to download the required installer.
(You still need to run the downloaded installer manually by yourself.)

### Viewing Metadata

Just drag and drop an image on the _image area_ of the app window (the left half).
You can drag a local file on your PC from File Explorer.
You can also drag a web image from some Web browsers such as Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.
(Some websites technically prohibit dragging an image from their sites, though.)

You can also click on the "+" button on the top-right corner to open a dialog box for an image file.

aiimeta provides handy ways to copy metadata _values_ to the clipboard, too,
so that you can paste them on your generation tools.

## Functionality

### AI Tools and Services

aiimeta can currently handle metadata generated by the following tools and services:

* [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) (often called "A1111"),
* [ComfyUI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI) and [Comfy Cloud](https://www.comfy.org/cloud),
* [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI), and
* [Civitai](https://civitai.com/) on-site generator.

Also, as A1111 is a kind of a de facto standard,
other tools and services may produce A1111-compatible metadata,
which aiimeta can handle.

Note, however, not all images generated by above tools and services carry their metadata in them.

### Image File Formats

aiimeta can handle the following image file formats.

* PNG
* JPEG
* WebP

I believe these three formats are all that _any_ AI image generation tools and services produce,
and they should be enough.
As long as, of course, talking about still images.
aiimeta doesn't support any video files for the moment.

## Limitations and Notes

### Preview image quality

The image shown on the left of the main window is only for a preview,
which often appears in a lower quality than the original.
(It is to improve the app's internal processing performance.)

### Error messages

aiimeta currently makes no effort to show a descriptive error message.
When it faces an error, such as "File not found",
it simply dumps its internal information on the error
(called _exception_ in programmers' terminology),
which is often not useful for typical users.

### Non-normalization

Terminology in generative AI technologies is a mess.
A same thing may be called with varieties of words,
and a same term may be used for completely different things.
Just for an example,
one tool may use three terms "model", "checkpoint", and "weights" interchangeably,
while another tool may uses all the three terms to refer to three different things.

aiimeta doesn't try to solve the confusion.
It just uses the word used in the metadata it is showing,
and never tries to _normalize_ the terms.
